      "Edward Snowden has warned that surveillance technology is so much more advanced and intrusive today it makes that used by US and British intelligence agencies he revealed in 2013 look like child’s play. In an interview on the 10th anniversary of his revelations about the scale of surveillance – some of it illegal – by the US National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ , he said he had no regrets about what he had done and cited positive changes. But he is depressed about inroads into privacy both in the physical and digital world. “Technology has grown to be enormously influential,” Snowden said. “If we think about what we saw in 2013 and the capabilities of governments today, 2013 seems like child’s play.” He expressed concern not only about dangers posed by governments and Big Tech but commercially available video surveillance cameras, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and intrusive spyware such as Pegasus used against dissidents and journalists. Looking back to 2013, he said: “We trusted the government not to screw us. But they did. We trusted the tech companies not to take advantage of us. But they did. That is going to happen again, because that is the nature of power.” Snowden has been in exile in Russia since 2013 after fleeing Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret documents to journalists. His detractors denounce him for being in Russia, though it appears to be the only realistic option available to him other than jail in the US. Criticism has intensified since the invasion of Ukraine and his acquisition of Russian citizenship last year, two years after he applied. But despite his personal predicament, Snowden does not dwell on the past. “I have no regrets,” he said. Snowden, MI5 and me: how the leak of the century came to be published Read more Snowden has reduced his public profile over the last two years, giving fewer speeches, and retreating from press interviews and social media. This is partly because of family commitments: he and his wife have two young sons. But he has remained in contact over the last decade with the three journalists who met him in Hong Kong, including this reporter. Friday marks exactly 10 years since Snowden revealed himself as the source of the leaks. Snowden views the widespread use of end-to-end encryption as one of the positive legacies of the leaks. The Big Tech companies had been embarrassed by revelations the NSA had been handing over personal data. That embarrassment turned to anger when further leaks revealed that, in spite of that cooperation, the NSA had been helping themselves to data from the Big Tech companies through backdoor vulnerabilities. In response, in spite of opposition from the agencies, companies rushed in end-to-end encryption years earlier than planned. End-to-end encryption “was a pipe dream in 2013 when the story broke”, Snowden said. “An enormous fraction of global internet traffic traveled electronically naked. Now, it is a rare sight.” What’s really changed 10 years after the Snowden revelations? Read more But Snowden is worried by technological advances that eat into privacy. “The idea that after the revelations in 2013 there would be rainbows and unicorns the next day is not realistic. It is an ongoing process. And we will have to be working at it for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and beyond.” The intelligence agencies in the US and the UK acknowledge there was benefit from the debate on privacy that Snowden provoked but still argue this is outweighed by the damage they claim was done to their capabilities, including MI6 having to close down human-intelligence operations. Their other complaint is that the narrative in 2013 portrayed the NSA and GCHQ as the sole malign actors, ignoring what Russia and China were doing on the internet. Snowden disputes such claims. He said no one at the time thought Russia and China were angels. As for damage, he said the agencies have never cited any evidence. “Disruption? Sure, that is plausible,” he said. “But it is hard to claim ‘damage’ if, despite 10 years of hysterics, the sky never fell in.”",

      "Rob MacNeill, head of Vertical Madness, took Mayor Kermit Dahl and Business and Economic Development officers on a tour of his facility June 6. Photo by Edward Hitchins/Campbell River Mirror Leah Knutson, Business Development Officer for the city, says she is excited about the potential business and employment opportunities MacNeill’s trade school will give current and future students. Photo By Edward Hitchins/Campbell River Mirror Rob MacNeill chats with Leah Knutson during a break of the tour of Vertical Madness June 6. Photo by Edward Hitchins/Campbell River Mirror. The hits just keep on coming for Rob MacNeill’s Vertical Madness and industrial sewing program. In partnership with North Island College and Excel Career College in Courtenay, MacNeill’s program has been approved as a trade diploma program, with the City of Campbell River providing funding. This means that NIC will provide a diploma in an industrial trade program taught by McNeill. READ MORE: Campbell River teacher Rob McNeill empowers his students through skilled trade expertise MacNeill spoke of the opportunities this news is going to give his students who attend Robron Centre, Timberline and Carihi, and of the future adults at NIC and Excel he’ll be able to teach industrial sewing to. “It’s incredibly overwhelming,” said MacNeill, holding back his emotions while being asked about the news. “We’re looking forward to having this future joint teaching and learning opportunity to provide for the city.” Carihi Secondary Teacher Tracy Finkensiep, who has been coming to MacNeill’s shop with her classes for the past several years, says MacNeill’s class gives the children an added benefit, as well as learning a new skill. “It can’t hurt,” said Finkensiep speaking about the funding. “This is a completely different learning environment. Learning new skills and from a non-traditional teacher. He may do things a little unorthodox. But it works. Rob will be training kids and young adults. There’s another avenue for employment. It’s not them going into a fast food place to work and perhaps hating the world.” MacNeill was joined for the tour by Campbell River Mayor Kermit Dahl, as well as Economic and Business Development Officers Rose Klukas and Leah Knutsen. They were led throughout the facility, with MacNeill showing them the various materials his crew works on, including upholstery for boats and cars as well as designing parachutes, as well as meeting staff. With MacNeill being a former member of the military, he finished his presentation by showing a documentary about Operation Pegasus Jump, an annual skydiving event featuring veterans in Campbell River. All give MacNeill top marks. “There is definite potential for industrial sewing here in Campbell River and the region,” Knutsen said. “With so many contracts Rob has going on, and the ones potentially coming in this is no doubt going to have a big impact on the economy.” “I think it’ll be great for the community, for youth development and employment,” said Mayor Dahl after leaving the tour. “I’m most excited for the kids to get opportunities to do something worthwhile in Campbell River.” Edward Hitchins edward.hitchins@campbellrivermirror.com Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter Advanced Education Campbell River skilled trades",

      'With this week marking 10 years since whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed information to journalists about widespread government spying by United States and British agencies, the former National Security Agency contractor on Thursday joined other advocates in warning that the fight for privacy rights, while making several inroads in the past decade, has grown harder due to major changes in technology."If we think about what we saw in 2013 and the capabilities of governments today," Snowden told The Guardian, "2013 seems like child\'s play."Snowden said that the advent of commercially available surveillance products such as Ring cameras, Pegasus spyware, and facial recognition technology has posed new dangers.As Common Dreams has reported, the home security company Ring has faced legal challenges due to security concerns and its products\' vulnerability to hacking, and has faced criticism from rights groups for partnering with more than 1,000 police departments—including some with histories of police violence—and leaving community members vulnerable to harassment or wrongful arrests.Law enforcement agencies have also begun using facial recognition technology to identify crime suspects despite the fact that the software is known to frequently misidentify people of color—leading to the wrongful arrest and detention earlier this year of Randal Reid in Georgia, among other cases."Despite calls over the last few years for federal legislation to rein in Big Tech companies, we\'ve seen nothing significant in limiting tech companies\' ability to collect data."Last month, journalists and civil society groups called for a global moratorium on the sale and transfer of spyware like Pegasus, which has been used to target dozens of journalists in at least 10 countries.Protecting the public from surveillance "is an ongoing process," Snowden told The Guardian on Thursday. "And we will have to be working at it for the rest of our lives and our children\'s lives and beyond."In 2013, Snowden revealed that the U.S. government was broadly monitoring the communications of citizens, sparking a debate over surveillance as well as sustained privacy rights campaigns from groups like Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Fight for the Future."Technology has grown to be enormously influential," Snowden told The Guardian on Thursday. "We trusted the government not to screw us. But they did. We trusted the tech companies not to take advantage of us. But they did.

"It\'s why so many cities and states have had to take it upon themselves to ban face recognition or predictive policing, or pass laws to protect consumer privacy and stop biometric data collection without consent.""It\'s been 10 years since the Snowden revelations," they added, "and Congress needs to wake up and finally pass some legislation that actually protects our privacy, from companies as well as from the NSA directly."',

Jack Smith in recent weeks has been using a Miami grand jury to hear evidence against Donald Trump in the classified documents probe, and all indications are that the special counsel is likely to try the case against the former president in South Florida. But legal experts warn that the region is a historically is a tough place to secure convictions in federal cases against politicians and celebrities, The Messenger reports , noting that “Trump is both.” Richard Gregorie, a former Miami-based federal prosecutor told The Messenger that Trump enjoys far more support in South Florida than in Washington D.C. In the 2020 election, just 5 percent of D.C. voters backed Trump, compared to 45 percent in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, The Washington Post reports . “I would absolutely try this case in Washington D.C.,” Gregorie said. “People who operate in D.C. have no idea what it’s like down here. Prosecuting politicians is hard here,” he added. “The people are just suspicious of government all over South Florida.” Gregorie during his storied career won convictions against Panamanian President Manuel Noriega and Colombian cocaine traffickers with the Medellin Cartel, among other high-profile defendants. But Gregorie lost two unrelated public corruption cases against former Miami-area mayors in the city of Hialeah, Julio Robaina and Raul Martinez, in cases in 2014 and the 1990s, the report said, noting that those experiences give him pause when considering trying Trump in South Florida. Criminal defense attorney David Oscar Markus echoed Gregorie’s view. “Forget documents,” if Trump shot someone on Calle Ocho, a Miami jury would find him not guilty,” Markus said.

CONTINUE READING Show less The Lincoln Project on Thursday slammed Mike Pence in a newly released video that juxtaposes comments the former vice president made hours apart on Thursday over his complicated relationship with Donald Trump . The ad starts out with video from Pence’s announcement that he’s running for president at Des Moines Area Community College in which he issued a strong rebuke of the former president. Pence assails Trump over his pressuring him when he was vice president to overturn the results of the 2020 election that the former president falsely claimed was stolen. “Anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” Pence is shown saying in the video. “And anyone who asked someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again.” But the video points out that, hours later, Pence was singing a different tune during his appearance at a CNN town hall in which he promised to “support the Republican nominee in 2024, especially if it’s me.” Dana Bash, who hosted the town hall, asks Pence to square the apparent discrepancy between his promise to support the nominee in a race in which Trump is considered a prohibitive favorite with his suggestion earlier in the day that he should never be president. “So then how can you say that you would support him if he’s the nominee?” Bash asks him. “Well, because I don’t think Donald Trump is going to be the nominee,” Pence replies. Asked by Bash, “but what if he is,” Pence says that “I have great confidence in the Republican primary voters, very confident that we’ll be able to support the Republican nominee for president of the United States, and I hope it’s me.” The video ends with text that says: "Mike Pence knows, but he’ll never say." "It’s America or Trump." Watch the video below or click here . Pence Knows www.youtube.com CONTINUE READING Show less Former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr , once one of the ex-president’s top defenders, appeared stunned and speechless Thursday afternoon when a Fox News host surprised him by asking why the U.S. Dept. of Justice is pursuing a criminal investigation against Trump over classified documents while he is running again for president. “Why is this process happening so quickly in the middle of a presidential election?” Fox’s Martha MacCallum asked. She neglected to mention that Donald Trump reportedly announced his presidential campaign to avoid being charged . Barr, who is on record stating he opposes Trump’s actions surrounding the hundreds of classified and top secret documents he likely unlawfully removed from the White House and refused to return, paused for several seconds before replying. “Uh,” Barr finally replied, “This, this was a fairly simple case,” he said, appearing to defend DOJ. “The Mar-a-Lago case. This is a case that can be done relatively quickly, and that’s why I thought, it’s the main – because it’s a very limited question,” Barr explained, shifting gears. “It relates to, ah, one collection of documents and and why they weren’t given to the government once they were subpoenaed. And it’s a pretty simple case.” Moving on, MacCallum asked, “And you believe that the charge will be obstruction, based on what you’ve said before?” “Yeah, yeah,” Barr responded, seeming to not want to bet pinned down to an answer, “if I had to bet I think that that there’s going to be an indictment here on that basis, but it’s not going to be because he took the documents, or even had the documents for a while. I think it’s because they believe that he acted deceitfully once the government tried to get the documents back.” On Tuesday, Barr spoke with CBS News to refute his ex-boss’s “witch hunt” claims , said the ex-president had “jerked” DOJ around over the hundreds of classified and top secret documents he refused to return, and added there was “no excuse” to do so.
